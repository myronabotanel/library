# 📚 Library Management System

## 📖 Description
I developed a **Java application** for managing a library system that includes three types of users:

- 🏛 **Administrators** - Can add and remove employees.
- 📚 **Employees** - Can manage books, clients, and orders.
- 👤 **Clients** - Can browse and request books.

The application follows a **layered architecture** and **SOLID principles**, ensuring a **scalable** and **maintainable** structure. All data is validated before being stored in the database, and the application is built using **best practices in software development**.
